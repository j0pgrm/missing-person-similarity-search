In this python file, the user is being asked specific questions about their missing loved one like "age", "race", "location", etc. With these inputs, the code tries to find which cases in the NamUs database are most similar to the user's inputs. It does this by first off cleaning and normalizing the data to then be able to run similarity algorithms like Jaccard, Euclidean, and Haversine. In the end, 10 cases are printed off, which are the 10 most similar cases in the database to the user inputs. Each case is paired with its website link to the NamUs case which can have the user potentially get in contact with the case PD and then to contact the family of missing person. In conclusion, the purpose of this is to have families that are experiences similar events to be able to connect to have that empathy, understanding, and support from one another.
